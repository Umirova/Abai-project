                <p> 
                    

                    Whether for good or ill, I have lived my life, travelling a long road fraught with 
                    struggles 
                    and quarrels, disputes and arguments, suffering and anxiety, and reached these advanced years to find
                     myself at the end of my tether, tired of everything. I have realized the vanity and futility of my 
                     labors and the meanness of my existence. What shall I occupy myself with now and how shall I live out 
                     the rest of my days? I am puzzled that I can find no answer to this question.
                     <br>
                     <br>

                     <img src="./images/word1.jpeg" alt="word-1" id="word1">

                    Rule the people? No, the people are ungovernable. Let this burden be shouldered by someone who is
                     willing to contract an incurable malady, or else by an ardent youth with a burning heart. But may 
                     Allah spare me this load which is beyond my powers! Shall I multiply the herds? No, I cannot do that.
                      Let the young folk raise livestock if they need them. But I shall not darken the evening of my days 
                      by tending livestock to give joy to rogues, thieves and spongers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Occupy myself with learning? But how shall I engage in scholarship when I have no one to exchange an 
                    intelligent word with? And then to whom shall I pass on the knowledge I will have amassed? Whom shall 
                    I ask what I do not know myself? What’s the good of sitting on a desolate steppe with an arshin in
                     hand trying to sell cloth? Too much knowledge becomes gall and wormwood that hastens old age if you 
                     have no one by your side to share your joys and sorrows. Choose the path of the Sufi and dedicate 
                     myself to the service of religion? No, I’m afraid that won’t do either. This vocation calls for 
                     serenity and complete peace of mind. But I have not known peace either in my soul or in my
                     life-and what sort of piety can there be amongst these people, in this land!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Educate children, maybe? No, this, too, is beyond my powers. I could instruct children,
                     true, but I don’t know what I should teach them and how.
                     <br>
                     <br>

                    For what occupation, for what purpose and for what kind of community am I to educate 
                    them? How can I instruct them and direct their paths if I don’t see where my pupils
                    could usefully apply their learning? 
                    And so here, too, I have been unable to put myself to any good use.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Well, I have decided at length: henceforth, pen and paper shall be my only solace,
                     and I shall set down mythoughts. Should anyone find something useful here, lethim c
                     opy it down or memorise it. And if no one has anyneed of my words, they will remain 
                     with me anyway. And now I have no other concern than that.

            <h2>WORD TWO</h2>
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>
                    In my childhood I used to hear the Kazakhs jeering at the Uzbeks: “You Starts in 
                    wide skirts, you bring your rushes from afar to thatch your roofs! You bow and scrape
                    when you meet someone, but you insult him behind his back. You are afraid of every 
                    bush; you rattle on without stopping, and that’s why they call you Sart-Surts.”
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Encountering Nogais, the Kazakhs would ridicule and scold them, too: “The Nogai is
                     afraid of the camel, he soon gets tired astride a horse and takes his rest walking.
                      Runaways and soldiers and traders - all of them hail from the Nogais. Nokai is what 
                      you should be called, not Nogai!”
                    <br>
                    <img src="./images/word2.jpeg" alt="word-2" id="word2">
                    <br>

                    About the Russians they used to say: “The red-headed Urus, once he spies an aul, 
                    gallops fit to break his neck towards it, permits himself to do whatever comes into his 
                    head, demands to hear all the rumours and gossip, and believes everything he is told.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “My God!” I thought then with pride. “It turns out that the whole wide world has no 
                    worthier and nobler people than the Kazakhs!” Such talk rejoiced and entertained me. 
                    But this is what I see now: there is no plant that the Sarts cannot grow, no land that
                    their merchants have not visited, and no such thing that their nimble fingers cannot 
                    contrive. Their laymen live in peace and seek no enmity. Before there were any Russian 
                    merchants around, the Sarts provided the Kazakhs with clothes for the living and burial 
                    robes for the dead, and they would buy up from the Kazakhs droves of cattle that father 
                    and son could not agree to divide between themselves. Now, under the Russians, the Sarts
                    have adopted the innovations more quickly than others. Exalted beys and learnt mullahs, 
                    craftsmanship and luxury and courtesy-the Sarts have all these.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I look at the Nogais and see that they can make fine soldiers and that they bear 
                    deprivation stoically. They face death with humility, protect schools and honour 
                    religion - they know how to work hard and grow rich, and to dress up and have fun. Not 
                    we Kazakhs, though: we labour for their beys for a crust of bread. They will not let our
                    beys into their homes. “Hey, you Kazakhs,” they say, “our floor is not for your dirty 
                    boots to trample on.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I will not speak of the Russians. We cannot hold a candle even to their servants.
                    Where has all our erstwhile joyfulness gone? Where is our merry laughter?
                     <br>
