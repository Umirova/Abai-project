              <p><strong>Abai</strong> is a well-known Kazakh poet, a great thinker, composer, philosopher,
                 the founder of written Kazakh literature, and its first classic.
                 <br>
                 <br>

                The heritage he left his nation is rich in songs and poems, 
                translations and prose. His translations of the poetry written by Russian writers
                 and poets such as Pushkin, Lermontov, and Krylov became the national patrimony of 
                 Kazakhstan. He translated the works of Schiller, Goethe, and Byron into Kazakh language.
                <br>
                <br>
                Abai Kunanbaev is the Shakesphere of Kazakh literature. His <strong>Book of Words,</strong>
                 «Kara Sozder», created by the great thinker constitute an ethnic philosophical work. 
                 This creation of his is an exploration of Kazakh national life in the second half of
                  the 19th century. He influenced social affairs in the country where he lived.
                <br>
                <br>
                He also participated in the governing of the country and played a certain role in trying 
                to solve complicated problems justly.
                <br>
                <br>

                The name of Abai is known worldwide just as Shakespeare, Goethe, and Pushkin are well-known 
                in many countries, because his great words became a spiritual patrimony of not only one nation,
                 but of the entire humankind.
                 <br>
                 <br>

                Abay’s main contribution to Kazakh culture and folklore lies in his poetry, which expresses
                great nationalism and grew out of Kazakh folk culture. Before him, most Kazakh poetry was oral,
                echoing the nomadic habits of the people of the Kazakh steppes. During Abay’s lifetime, 
                however, a number of important socio-political and socio-economic changes occurred. Russian
                influence continued to grow in Kazakhstan, resulting in greater educational possibilities 
                as well as exposure to a number of different philosophies, whether Russian, Western or Asian.
                Abay Qunanbayuli steeped himself in the cultural and philosophical history of these newly 
                opened geographies. In this sense, 
                Abay’s creative poetry affected the philosophical thinking of educated Kazakhs.
